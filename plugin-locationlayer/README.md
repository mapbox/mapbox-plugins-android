## Deprecation
The location layer plugin is no longer maintained and the whole functionality as well as the future development has been moved to the Mapbox Maps SDK for Android and usage doesn't require any additional dependencies.

Follow [`LocationComponent` documentation](https://www.mapbox.com/android-docs/maps/overview/location-component/) for more information.
